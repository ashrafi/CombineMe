/*
 Classes can inherit from another class, which you can’t do with structs. With classes, you can write class MyViewController : UIViewController to create a subclass of UIViewController. Conversely, structs can implement protocols.
 Classes can be deinitialized, i.e. they can implement a deinit function, and you can make one or more references to the same class (i.e., classes are a reference type).
 Classes come with the built-in notion of identity, because they’re reference types. With the identity operator === you can check if two references (variables, constants, properties, etc.) refer to the same object.
